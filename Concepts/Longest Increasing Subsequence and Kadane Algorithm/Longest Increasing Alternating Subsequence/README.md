It's a bit diffiult then Longest Increasing Even or Odd subsequence . In this Subsequence Any two adjacent Numbers in the sequence should have different Parity . Such that, if a number is even then the number before and after should be odd and vice versa . For the First Number of the sequence , If a number is even then the Number after it should be a odd number and vice versa . Beside this Condition , The sequence should also be Increasing .
